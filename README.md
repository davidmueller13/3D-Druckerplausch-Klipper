# This repository is outdated and archived!

> Due to our dear friend @Prutsium going over the rainbow bridge, this project is abandoned.
> 
> The Co-Developer @OXERY also doesn't own Prusa printers any more, therefore this repository won't be updated.
> 
> In the last years, we switched over to RatRig and Voron, which is why this repository wasn't updated for recent Klipper versions.
> 
> If you are looking for a decent alternative, take a look at https://os.ratrig.com, as it provides also good config files and many more features for RatRig-, Prusa- and Voron-Printers.

Repo for config file(s) for Prusa MK3(S)(+) and others with Klipper

Please see the wiki for advanced information how we set up Klipper on our Prusa printers.

This repository is meant in general for klipper but has a big focus on Prusa MK3(S)(+) with Klipper.
We try to collect here first of all working and complete configurations and these have been build up in a modular way so it would be easy to add or remove something or when we add a specific config for a specific part you wont need to modify your configuration but just include it in your original configuration.

We are still in a setup process but we try to document as much as possible.

The Wiki will be a main guideline on how to flash but also explanations how certain parts work.

# ToDo

- Klipper Setup on Raspberry and Prusa
- Restore Prusa firmware
- Config file description and how includes work
- 3-Axis tilt module -> resonance etc
- ...
